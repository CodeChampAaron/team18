# Team 18 - CISC275 - Spring 2023
This is the software engineering project for CISC275 by Professor Harvey.
Team Members: Sydni Wright, Kaitlyn Sullivan, Aaron Oster, Will Sharp, Cornelia Meiss

We are creating a website that allows users to create ToDo-Lists to structure their days.
Users can choose from a variety of different tasks to build their own ToDo-List and customize their tasks by adding difficulty levels, descriptions, images, etc.
Once they completed a task they can check it off.
