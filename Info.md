Mike Ox: Plan to use the app to create a healthy schedule by creating custom tasks
inputting them into a list that gives me a time representation of what I can expect out of 
my day. I would also like to be able to send this to my friends via email or text in order 
to help find proper time schedules. 
I would like it to give me a rating of how attainable this is via user input.

Turley Curd: Constantly looking to meet up and collaborate with other influencers and 
schedule meetings with sponsors. Need an application that can artificially 
generate potential meeting times based on input given and then give this to me 
so it can streamline my ability to plan things. 
Besides this just merely listing basic tasks

Henry Hooville: Wishing to just have something allow me to list my ideas out and send them to
my wife so she does not leave me and allow her to collaborate and generate a time later 
on so we can have our date nights together again. She also wants me to find a program that 
can help me restructure my day so 
I can man up and spend time with my kids and not be a deadbeat. I also must schedule time daily 
so I can get my test levels up so my wife does not leave me.
